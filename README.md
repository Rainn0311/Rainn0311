## Hi there 

- I'm a software engineering student at university (currently in Grade 3).

- I pity that I have not studied and learned from this website until today.

- But as the saying goes: 种一棵树最好的时间是十年前，其次是现在， 
which means: The best time to plant a tree is ten years ago. The second best time is now.
So moving up and starting coding is what I should do now.

- I'm currently working on front-end development, and know a little about back-end as well.

- How to reach me: 3298257615@qq.com or super123keng@gmail.com
